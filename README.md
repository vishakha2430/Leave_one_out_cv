# Leave_one_out_cv
This repository contains a practical implementation of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) using Python. LOOCV is a powerful technique in model evaluation, where each data point is used once as a test set while the remaining points form the training set. This method provides an unbiased estimate of model performance, making it ideal for small datasets or when a thorough assessment of model accuracy is required.

Key Features:
-Detailed implementation of LOOCV from scratch.

-Step-by-step explanation of the process.

-Example code demonstrating LOOCV with a sample dataset.

-Comparison of model performance with and without cross-validation.

-Well-documented code for easy understanding and customization.

-Getting Started:
-Clone this repository and explore the implementation to understand how LOOCV can be applied to your own machine learning projects.

-Prerequisites:

-Jupyter Notebook

-Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn (for the example)

-How to Use:
-Download the repository.
-Follow the examples provided in the loocv_example.ipynb file.
-Modify the code to suit your dataset and model.
